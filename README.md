change time

A new way of creating and perceiving time.

Why are we locked in to 12 am and 12 pm hours.

Proposal:
As "times" change so does our perception of time. The need of a continuous understanding of time is necessary to be able to relate to our peers. We need to create some order from the chaos. this is undeniable.

But why don't we allow our time to evlove as well? Why do i have to stay in the constraints of societal perspective within my individual realm?

I prupose a function that will change everything. As desceribed by "cognitime" check link

This simple figure 8 can be the consentual figure where peers can relate to each other.

But when it comes to my time. I would like to choose my shape, speed and sectioning... I prupose that the ability to change the functionality of the watch/preferably clock, something table and presentable like on a ipad or a screen widget. I can draw the time I would like to control.

So:
Shape time moves across
Sectioning of time
Speed of time

How will this change perception and task oriented framing of days?
how will this change the overall perception through out the day, with others?

Please write me directly or add to the request.

I'm new here, i\ve had this idea for awhile, hoping others will find interest.
